# Course Info

Through HOPE, you will learn effective printed circuit board (PCB) design and develop the skills to build custom electronics for classes, personal projects, student teams, and more. You will learn effective system, schematic, and layout design for PCBs through hands-on labs and experience basic PCB assembly and bringup. You will also be exposed to some advanced PCB design topics such as DFx, signal and power integrity, grounding, and thermals. At the end of the semester, you will combine all of your skills in a student design project.

### Enrolling in HOPE

Students who are interested in signing up for HOPE in Spring 2025 should fill out [THIS](https://example.com) enrollment form to recieve a permission code (they will be distributed in batches, first come first serve). Our DeCal listing for Fall '24 was [https://decal.berkeley.edu/courses/7583](https://decal.berkeley.edu/courses/7583).

Please email us if you are a concurrent enrollment student- we prioritize matriculated UC Berkeley students. Space permitting, however, concurrent enrollment students are welcome to take HOPE.

Classes begin week of DATE GO HERE.

We offer HOPE as an in-person class this semester. We plan to hold two identical sections of class each week (Tues and Wed), and you can choose which section to enroll in.

### Prerequisites

HOPE is not a class about circuits. We expect students to have a basic understanding of circuits. We heavily recommend students satisfy our pre-reqs of EE 16A or ME 100, or otherwise have a similar level of knowledge in circuits (e.g. PHYSICS 7B, BIOE 105).


## Grading

Your grade is primarily based on completion of labs and assignments. The final project is graded both on completion and demonstration of concepts taught in the course. Students need 70% to pass.

See bCourses for detailed grading breakdown. We will keep track of grade-related things in bCourses. Other course content will be found here on the website.

### Office Hours

For students that need extra support time, we will hold staff office hours at the Supernode (Cory 246). Check [HERE](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=Y19zNHVpbDdwa2d0NXZnYTRtNzAwYTVuaWRuNEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t&ref=ieee.studentorg.berkeley.edu) for availability.
