## FAQ

Remove the nav_exclude to make this page show up on the sidebar. You can do this for any other page too. Right now everything is a one-pager.

I've disabled the Scheduler, which doesn't really work well. The Modules tool is what you see on the main page.

Check out kevin.md under _schedules for an example of a staff member with all boxes enabled. Drag him into _staffers to view.

You can remove the taglines for each instructor to make them have no text. Just left them there as a default.


!!! 
To edit the schedule just modify Week-01 in Modules.
