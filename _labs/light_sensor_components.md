# Light Sensor Lab - Components

{:toc}

An essential part of making any idea into a practical reality is taking your abstract schematic symbols (which are meant to represent some electrical function but aren't tied to anything in reality) and assigning real, existing components to them. Learning where to find components and how to pick the right ones for your project is an essential skill, but the task can be overwhelming for those new to it. This activity will walk you through navigating the online marketplace Digikey.

## What is Digikey?
Digikey is an online marketplace for all manner of electronic components, and is one of the major (if not *the main*) parts distributors for electronic components. If you're making a PCB and need parts (or even a manufacturer for your PCB), Digikey is more likely than not going to have everything you need. They have tremendous amount of different kinds of available products, from the simplest, most common passives like tiny chip resistors and capacitors, to breakout boards for microcontrollers and fancy sensors, to even mechanical housings and bench test equipment.
