# Project Logistics

This page is a brief summary of the project logistics for the course.  Please read through the [full project spec document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1smVeWLNiplKkxcA6GZ_3y53MKBoSkndNkYT-nEIYHTI/edit?usp=sharing) at least once for a lot of very important information omitted here.

## Grading
Refer to the bCourses "Grading Breakdown" for grading details.

## Project Groups *(Due 2/21/25 11:59pm)*
We recommend you work in groups of 3-4 people.  Other group sizes may be allowed at instructor discretion.  If you are having trouble finding a group, fill out our group search form to be matched with other students: [Group Search Form](http://berkie.ee/hope-sp25-group-search).

Once you've formed your group, please fill out the following form: [Project Group Form](https://forms.gle/LzHeeZHy7nEBGzLN6).

***We expect all group members to contribute fairly to the project.***

For any group or project issues, it is always better to reach out to the instructors **early**.  (Please do not hesitate to make a public or private post on Ed, or email us!)

Submit your project group via [Google Forms](http://berkie.ee/hope-sp25-project-group-submission) once per group.

## Project Proposal *(Due 2/28/25 11:59pm)*

Your project will need to demonstrate some feature from at least three of the following categories:

| Category | Examples |
| ------- | ------- |
| ***Compute*** | Microcontroller, FPGA, discrete computation |
| ***Power*** | Switching regulator, LDOs, battery management |
| *Sensing* | Digital (e.g. I2C, SPI), resistance, current, voltage, HID |
| *Actuation* | Motors, servos, solenoids, lights, screens, sound, radio |
| *Other* | Multiple boards, purposeful mechanical design, analog processing |

By the nature of the project, the *Compute* and *Power* categories are required, so you just have to choose at least one from the remaining three categories.

> Refer to slides from Weeks 1 and 3 for inspiration and ideas!

> Please ask if you have questions about your project's scope.  The lists above are not exhaustive!

> A note on plagiarism: **Egregious copying of a schematic and/or layout is not acceptable.**
+ An example of egregious copying would be simply duplicating an open-source KiCad (or other PCB ECAD) project available online and moving/relabeling components.
+ If you are using an online project as inspiration, please include a reference to it.
+ *When in doubt, ask the instructors!*

Submit your proposal via [Google Forms](http://berkie.ee/hope-sp25-project-proposal-submission) once per group.

## Project Checkpoints
There will be two major checkpoints for your project to be submitted on bCourses that your two mentors will review and provide feedback on:
### Draft BOM, Schematic *(Due 3/14/25 11:59pm)*
This submission will contain a draft Bill of Materials (BOM) following the [standard HOPE template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZZAnW61lbqi8A5PHymeQs3MktsaBvQEssZroThjktFo/edit?usp=sharing), PDF exports of your schematic, and your project files.  See the bCourses assignment for more details.

Your project should be within the budget of $100 for **two copies** of your PCB.  If you are over budget, you will need to justify the cost, at which point it may or may not be approved.

### Draft Layout *(Due 3/28/25 11:59pm)*
See the bCourses assignment for details on what to submit.  Your layout should be mostly complete at this point.

## In-class Design Review *(Slides due the night before your lecture)*
This will be your chance to get your design reviewed by all the instructors and your peers!

Each group will (tentatively) get about 5 minutes to present and 2 minutes for questions.

Create a set of slides with [this template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sfXEulmNQYUn6Tx6N_VlQgELwYgzxpQMHi5ibLVOwzA/edit?usp=sharing) and submit the link to them on bCourses the night before the lecture your are scheduled to present in.

> Be ready to take notes on feedback as it will be valuable for your final submission!

> Obviously incomplete layouts will not be considered.

## Final Submission *(Due 4/10/25 11:59pm)*
***If your final submission is late, your board will not be sent for fabrication***

## Showcase *(5/4/25 - 5/9/25)*
The final showcase will be held during RRR week.  Details will be provided closer to the date.
